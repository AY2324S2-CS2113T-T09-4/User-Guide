# User Guide

![Logo](../img/logo.jpg)

## Introduction

Hello! Thank you for choosing to use PulsePilot!

Our team appreciates that you are giving our space-themed health application a try, and we hope that it helps you document your recovery journey better and bounce back from whatever injury you are facing.

This document serves as the **User Guide** of PulsePilot, designed to help you (an injured athlete) learn what PulsePilot is about, our motives, how to install it and how to use it.

Learning to use software can be daunting. Thus, this guide was created for **non-technical users**, helping you unleash PulsePilot to its fullest potential! That being said, we assume that you know how to use the basic features on your computer, such as **downloading files or copying and pasting text from one program to another**.

Once again, we hope our application helps you, and thank you for choosing PulsePilot, and we hope you recover as fast as possible!

> ‚ùó This is the **inexperienced user guide**. The **experienced** user guide for users familiar with installing PulsePilot, Java, using the terminal can be found [here](https://ay2324s2-cs2113t-t09-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html).

## Contact Us

If you have any queries with the guide, our application, or even **life in general**, please feel free to reach out to our project director **Justin Soh** at [+65 91234567](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBGIQ7ZuuiU)!

## How to use this guide

Before we delve into the content of what is PulsePilot and how to use it, we want to let you know and get familiar with the styling used in this guide, so that this guide can help you better!

### Glossary Usage

This guide may have difficult to understand technical jargon or terms used. Fret not! We understand that seeing such terms can be daunting to someone not familiar with it.

As such, our team has created a **Glossary** for you to refer to when reading this guide! It serves as a mini-dictionary, for you to read a definition and quickly go back to wherever you were.

Technical terms are marked in **italicised blue** [*like this*](#glossary-usage)! When you click on it, it brings you to the glossary. Each term in the glossary also contains a 'Go back' button, and clicking on that returns you to where you originally were. This is to create a seamless reading experience for you! 

Note that only **the first instance** of a term will be hyperlinked!

Give it a try with the term: [*Object-Oriented Programming*](#glossary).

The blue phrases known are also known as [*hyperlinks*](#glossary).

Non-italicised hyperlinks [like this](#glossary-usage) are used to bring you to different parts of the document.

For example, **the one below to bring you back to the table of contents on top!**

###### [Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

### Blocks

There are 3 different kinds of **blocks**, denoted using different **icons** to bring things to your attention.

> üí° This is an **information** block. It is used to highlight **additional** details that you might be interested in!

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a **warning** block. It is used to highlight key information that **may** be useful for you!

> ‚ùó This is an **important** block. It contains information that you **MUST READ**! Take note of these!

## PulsePilot

### What is it?

PulsePilot is an application made by computing students from the National University of Singapore (NUS) that helps you (the user) document each stage of your recovery journey better! More specifically, it was coded in [*Java*](#glossary).

The application is built for **both** healthcare professionals and patients. Using PulsePilot, patients can better record their recovery progress from an injury, as well as general well-being. 

Healthcare professionals on the other hand would use PulsePilot to view the information that a patient has logged, allowing them to better keep tabs on their patients' recovery status outside the hospital.

At the time of writing, you can do the following with PulsePilot:

  - Keep training logs of **both run and gym** workouts.
- Store information of your **past menstrual cycles and make predictions of future cycles**.
- Record past or present **medical appointment** information.
- Keep a log of your **Body Mass Index (BMI)**.  

More details about how to [install](#installation) and use [PulsePilot](#pulsepilot-commands) are covered below!

###### [Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

### Origins

On top of being NUS Computing students, our team members are all competitive athletes who have had past injuries and hence dealt with the healthcare system in Singapore.

We came together and realised that one common denominator was our unhappiness with the level of service received from the healthcare system when we were injured. We want to use our experience and knowledge about creating software learned from our university course to better the lives of all athletes in Singapore.

We have done extensive research on this problem, as well as received testimonials from both varsity and national-level athletes about their recovery experiences. In general, they too were unhappy with the level of service received.

The 2 main problems identified from our study were:

1. Poor communication between **healthcare professionals and patients** inhibiting medical progress:
 This can be caused by the long waiting periods in between sessions, by a patient seeing more than 1 specialist at a time or from the specialist having too many patients to monitor.

2. **Data Fragmentation**:
  As mentioned above, a patient can see many specialists, thus resulting in their information and hence recovery status being **spread out across different clinics, hospitals and people**. There is **no centralised system** for doctors to read patient data and for patients to update all doctors simultaneously.

The above problems gave rise to PulsePilot, the guide for which you are reading right now! PulsePilot was designed with both patients and healthcare professionals in mind to solve the 2 main problems identified above!

We hope that PulsePilot can bridge the information gap between you and your doctor, and we wish you a speedy recovery.

> ‚ùó This application is still in [*beta phase*](#glossary). As such it is not complete and more features will be added in future versions. Stay tuned for updates!

## Command Line Interface

> üí° This section explains what a [*Command Line Interface (CLI)*](#glossary) is. If you are already familiar with this, please feel free to move on to the [installation section](#installation) .

> ‚ö†Ô∏è For **inexperienced** users, if you are not familiar with what the CLI is, keep reading this section. PulsePilot is built to be run using the CLI, and its [*commands*](#glossary) are also entered through the CLI!

Let us begin exploring the [*Command Line Interface (CLI)*](#glossary)! This section is further broken down into the 2 most common operating systems: Windows and macOS. Remember that PulsePilot can be run on **any operating system with Java installed**!

Here is a sub table of contents, so you can navigate through this section easily:

* [Windows](#windows)
  * [Launching `cmd.exe`](#launching-cmdexe)
  * [Windows Commands](#windows-commands)
* [macOS](#macos)
  * [Launching `Terminal`](#launching-terminal)
  * [macOS Commands](#macos-commands)

###### [Back to table of contents](#table-of-contents)

---

### Windows

#### Launching `cmd.exe`

Let us first begin with launching the command line for Windows. The name of this program is `cmd.exe`!

To do so, firstly, hit the <kbd>Windows</kbd> key on your keyboard to bring up the **Start Menu**:

![Start Menu](img_2101/windows/windows_start.png)

> üí° If you are unable to see a search bar after bringing up the Start Menu, you should be able to type immediately after doing so to immediately start searching!

Afterward, type `cmd` or `Command Prompt` into the search bar above or in the [*Taskbar*](#taskbar-windows), and there should be 1 program found called the '**Command Prompt**'.

![Finding cmd.exe](img_2101/windows/finding_cmd_exe.png)

Go ahead and click on that, and a _black_ window should pop up on your screen looking similar to this:

![Launching cmd.exe](img_2101/windows/windows_cmd_exe.png)

Congratulations, you have successfully launched the CLI for Windows!

The string `C:\Users\rouvi` is the current [*directory*](#glossary) that you are in! This means that currently, the **CLI** is within the `C:\Users\rouvi` folder of the computer.

> ‚ùó The directory and CLI for you may look different from the one shown in the guide! This is **normal** as the guide was created using a different computer. As long as the top of the window shows '**Command Prompt**', you are good to go!

You can type different things into the CLI, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to make your computer read the input and process it as a command.

For example, entering `hello` results in this output: 

![Typing Commands](img_2101/windows/sample_windows_type.png)

`hello` is not a valid command to use with `cmd.exe`, and your computer will let you know it is not a recognised command as shown in the image above.

Read the next section to learn some basic commands!

#### Windows Commands

##### Changing Directories (`cd`)

There are many commands in Windows, but this guide will cover the basic few you need to use PulsePilot.

The first command is `cd`, short for **change directory**. It changes the **current** directory to the specified one. The format to use it is `cd <DIRECTORY>`, where `<DIRECTORY>` is something you pick!

For example, suppose you want to go to the `cli_demo` folder from my current directory. You would use `cd cli_demo`:

![cd](img_2101/windows/cd.png)

Note how `C:\Users\rouvi` now has `\cli_demo` appended to the back. This means that the directory has been changed successfully.

If you `cd` to a directory that does not exist, your terminal will let you know it cannot find such a directory:

![cd error](img_2101/windows/cd_error.png)

If you want to go 'back' one directory, use `cd ..`.

> üí° `..` means the previous directory.

![cd ..](img_2101/windows/cd_back.png)

##### List Directory Contents (`dir`)

Now, suppose you want to view files a directory has within it. You can use `dir` to do so. 

For example, if you want to view what files are within the `cli_demo` folder. You would first `cd` to the `cli_demo` folder, and then use `dir` to view the output:

![cd then dir](img_2101/windows/cd_dir.png)

This would print out all the folders within the directory. In the `cli_demo` directory, you may have a `hello.txt` and a `pulsepilot.txt` file. 

For example, if you also have another folder within `cli_demo` called `another_directory`. Your computer differentiates between files and directories using the `<DIR>` [*string*](#glossary) printed before the name of the file or folder.

That is all the commands you need to know to navigate through the Windows CLI and use PulsePilot! To summarise:

* `dir` - Lists the files and directories in the current directory.
* `cd <DIRECTORY>` - Changes the current directory to the specified one.

### macOS

#### Launching `Terminal`

On macOS, the default command line interface is called the **Terminal**. 

To launch the **Terminal**:

1. To begin searching for **Terminal**, you may choose either of the methods listed below:
   - **Launchpad**: The Launchpad appears as a grid of app icons on your Mac's [*Dock*](#icon-dictionary). You can usually find it in the bottom of your screen.
   
        ![Launchpad](img_2101/macos/launchpad.png)

   - **Spotlight Search Bar**: Click on the search icon at the **top right** of your screen to bring up the Spotlight Search Bar.

     ![Search Icon](img_2101/macos/search_icon.png)
     ![Spotlight Search Bar](img_2101/macos/spotlight_search.png)
    
        > üí° Pressing <kbd>‚åò command</kbd> + <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> on your keyboard at the same time should produce the same result.

2. Search for `Terminal`: 
   - **Launchpad**: In the Launchpad search bar, type `Terminal` and you should see 1 program found called the '**Terminal**'. Click on it to launch **Terminal**.
   
        ![Terminal in Launchpad](img_2101/macos/launchpad_terminal.png)

   - **Spotlight Search Bar**: type `Terminal` and you should see 1 program found called the '**Terminal**'. Click on it to launch **Terminal**.
   
        ![Terminal in Spotlight Search Bar](img_2101/macos/spotlight_terminal.png)

3. Open the **Terminal** App: After clicking on the **Terminal** app icon to launch the **Terminal** application, you should now see a _white_, _grey_ or _black_ window pop up on your screen looking similar to this:

    ![Terminal](img_2101/macos/terminal.png)

Congratulations, you have successfully launched the CLI for macOS!

The string `~` in `l5z@L5Z-MacBook-Air ~ %` is the current directory that you are in! This means that currently, the **CLI** is within the `~` directory (or folder) of the computer.
This string will be **updated** to always reflect the directory you are currently in while navigating. 

The image below shows that you are currently in the `Desktop` directory:

![Terminal Directory String](img_2101/macos/cd_desktop.png)


> ‚ùó The directory and CLI for you may look different from the one shown in the guide! This is **normal** as the guide was created using a different computer. As long as the top of the window shows `zsh`, you are good to go!

You can type different things into the CLI, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to make your computer read the input and process it as a command.

For example, entering `hello` results in this output: 

![Typing Commands](img_2101/macos/sample_mac_type.png)

`hello` is not a valid command to use with `Terminal`, and your computer will let you know it is not a recognised command as shown in the image above.

Read the next section to learn some basic commands!

#### macOS Commands

The macOS **Terminal** allows you to enter and execute commands. If you are on the latest macOS (macOS Sonoma 14 as of this writing), you may refer [here](https://support.apple.com/en-sg/guide/terminal/trmld4c92d55/mac) for detailed information.

##### Changing Directories (`cd`)

There are many commands in macOS, but this guide will cover the basic few you need to use PulsePilot.

The first command is `cd`, short for **change directory**. It changes the **current** directory to the specified one. 
The format to use it is `cd <DIRECTORY>`, where `<DIRECTORY>` is the directory you would like to navigate to **within your current directory**!

For example, suppose you want to go to the `cli_demo` folder from the current directory, `Desktop`.

![cd_desktop](img_2101/macos/cd_desktop.png)

Since `cli_demo` is a directory within `Desktop` (as seen below), you can use `cd <DIRECTORY>`:

![cd](img_2101/macos/cd.png)

Note how `l5z@L5Z-MacBook-Air Desktop %` now has `cli_demo` replacing `Desktop`. This means that the directory has been changed successfully.

If you `cd` to a directory that does not exist, your **Terminal** will let you know it cannot find such a directory:

![cd error](img_2101/macos/cd_error.png)

If you want to go 'back' one directory, use `cd ..`.

> üí° `..` means the previous immediate directory.

![cd ..](img_2101/macos/cd_back.png)

##### List Directory Contents (`ls`)

Now, suppose you want to view files contained within a directory.

The `ls` command lists the files and folders in your current directory.
To use it, simply type `ls` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

Suppose you want to view what files are within the `cli_demo` folder. You would first `cd` to the `cli_demo` folder, and then use `ls` to view the present:

![cd then ls](img_2101/macos/cd_ls.png)

This would print out all the files and folders within the directory.

In the `cli_demo` directory, there is a `hello.txt` and a `pulsepilot.txt` file contained within the `cli_demo` directory.
There is another folder within `cli_demo` called `another_directory`.

> üí° **Generally**, you can differentiate between files and directories by the name. If it has a period('.') in the name, it is likely to be a file.
> Should you encounter any issues, you may refer [here](#macos-fix) for additional details. 

That is all the commands you need to know to navigate through the Windows CLI and use PulsePilot! To summarise:


- **List Directory Contents (`ls`)**: The `ls` command lists the files and folders in your current directory.
  - Simply type `ls` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
- **Change Directory (`cd <DIRECTORY>`)**: The `cd` command changes the current directory to the specified one in `<DIRECTORY>`
  - Type `cd`, followed by <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> and enter the name of the directory you would like to navigate to. Finally, press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
  - _Example_: `cd Desktop`

## Installation

Now that you are familiar with the CLI, it is time to install Java and PulsePilot!

The installation for Java is different for Windows and macOS computers. However, the installation and launching of PulsePilot is the same for both operating systems!

* [Installing Java](#installing-java)
* [Installing and Launching PulsePilot](#installing-and-launching-pulsepilot)

### Installing Java

> üí° If you already have Java 11 installed, feel free to skip to the [next section](#pulsepilot-commands) to learn about the commands for PulsePilot.

Java 11 will be required for PulsePilot. A guide to install Java can be found [here](https://nus-cs2030.github.io/1920-s2/contents/guides/settingUpJava.html), as many other NUS modules use a similar version of Java for their projects.

>‚ùóAlthough the website says it is for CS2030 from a previous semester, the steps are the same.

### Installing and Launching PulsePilot

> üí° If you already have PulsePilot installed, feel free to skip to the [next section](#pulsepilot-commands) to learn about the commands for PulsePilot.

PulsePilot can be installed from our team's [*GitHub*](#glossary) repository [here](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113T-T09-4/tp/releases/tag/v2.1).

The screen should have the following hyperlinks as shown below, and clicking on `pulsepilot.jar` will download the application to your `Downloads` folder.

![Downloading PulsePilot](img_2101/installation/download_pulsepilot.png)

Afterwards, launch the CLI, `cd` to your Downloads folder, and run `java -jar pulsepilot.jar`. If Java has been installed correctly, and you are in the correct directory, PulsePilot will launch successfully.

Your terminal should look like this below, with PulsePilot asking for your name.

![Launching PulsePilot](img_2101/installation/launch_pulsepilot.png)

### Common Problems

> üí° If you do not face any issues with launching PulsePilot, feel free to skip to the [next section](#pulsepilot-commands) to learn about the commands for PulsePilot.

This section will address some common problems you might face.

#### Wrong Directory

When attempting to launch `pulsepilot.jar` from the wrong directory, this error will appear:

Windows:

![Wrong Directory Windows](img_2101/windows/wrong_dir.png)

macOS:

![Wrong Directory macOS](img_2101/macos/wrong_dir.png)

This means that `pulsepilot.jar` is **not within your current directory**. To remediate this, use `dir` for Windows or `ls` for macOS to check for the files present within your current directory.

If you are in the right directory, `pulsepilot.jar` should appear like so:

Windows:

![Correct Directory Windows](img_2101/windows/correct_dir.png)

macOS:

![Correct Directory macOS](img_2101/macos/correct_dir.png)

##### Windows Fix

To fix this, do the following:

1. Find where `pulsepilot.jar` is within your machine using the [*File Explorer*](#glossary).

2. Right click on it and click on **Properties**.

    ![Windows Properties](img_2101/windows/properties_windows.png)

3. A separate window will appear with additional data for `pulsepilot.jar`. Copy the value of the **Location** part of the Properties window using <kbd>Ctrl + C</kbd> or highlighting the text, right-clicking it and selecting **Copy**.
  
    ![Finding Windows Path](img_2101/windows/windows_property_path.png)

4. Once copied, open the CLI for your device, and type `cd` and hit the <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> **once**, then paste the **Location** value you just copied using <kbd>Ctrl + V</kbd>. Then, hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>. You should see that you are now in the right directory, and use `dir` to verify that `pulsepilot.jar` is within this current directory.

    ![Right Directory](img_2101/windows/right_directory.png)

5. Continue to launch PulsePilot using `java -jar pulsepilot.jar`.

##### macOS Fix

To fix this, do the following:

1. Locate where `pulsepilot.jar` is within your computer with [*Finder*](#glossary).
   - You may use the Dock at the bottom of your screen or search for `pulsepilot.jar` with [*Spotlight Search*](#icon-dictionary).

2. Right click on it and click on **Get Info**.

   ![Get File Info](img_2101/macos/get_file_info.png)
   > üí° Press <kbd>‚åò command</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> on your keyboard at the same time after selecting the file should produce the same result.

3. A separate window will appear with additional data for `pulsepilot.jar`.

   ![File Info](img_2101/macos/file_info.png)

   Copy the value of the **Where** part of the Info window using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> or highlighting the text, right-clicking it and selecting **Copy**.

   ![Select File Info](img_2101/macos/file_info_selected.png)

4. Once copied, open **Terminal**, type `cd` and press <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> **once**, then paste the **Where** value you just copied using <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd>. Then, press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. You should see that you are now in the right directory, and use `ls` to verify that `pulsepilot.jar` is within this current directory.

   ![Right Directory](img_2101/macos/correct_dir.png)

5. Continue to launch PulsePilot using `java -jar pulsepilot.jar`.

### Workout

Being a health-tracking application, PulsePilot can record Run and Gym sessions. This is implemented via the `workout` command.

There are 2 types of exercises that can be recorded, denoted using the `/e:` flag.

- To add a run session, use `workout /e:run`.
- To add a gym session, use `workout /e:gym`.

There are details and flags required from you, which will be covered below.

---

#### Add Run

> üí°PulsePilot automatically calculates the pace of your run for you in minutes/km (i.e. `5.00/km`). This helps you track your progress better!

To add a run, the following details and flags must be specified in your input:

| Detail     | Description                                                 | Flag Used | Limitations                                                                                                                                                           |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `distance` | The distance ran in **kilometres**.                         | `/d:`     | Must be a **2 decimal point positive number** such as `5.15`. <br> Must be **at least** `0.01`, and is **capped at** `5000.00`.                                       |
| `time`     | The time taken for the run.                                 | `/t:`     | Must be in either `MM:SS` or `HH:MM:SS` format. <br> Must be **at least** `00:01`, and is capped at `99:59:59`.                                                       |
| `date`     | The date of the run. <br>This is an **OPTIONAL** parameter. | `/date:`  | Must be in `DD-MM-YYYY` format. <br> Date specified **cannot be after today's date**. (i.e. If today is `10-04-2024`, specifying `11-04-2024` will trigger an error!) |

> ‚ùó The `date` parameter is **OPTIONAL**. Not specifying one results in it being recorded as `NA` within PulsePilot, and it is okay!

> ‚ùó If the `HH` field in `time` is not needed and set to `00`, **an error message will be printed!**

The following example will cover how to add a run step-by-step.

1. Suppose you want to add **two** runs:

   - The first is a  **5.50km** run completed in **25 minutes and 12 seconds** on **7 March 2024**.
   - The second is a **20km** run completed in **2 hours, 13 minutes and 37 seconds** without a date.

2. Let's put the **first** run's details into the flags required:

    - A **5.50km** run is specified using the `distance` flag via `/d:5.50`.
    - **25 minutes and 12 seconds** is specified using the `time` flag via `/t:25:12`.
    - **7 March 2024** is specified using the `date` flag via `/date:07-03-2024`.

3. Putting it together, the full command is:

   <code style="color: green">workout /e:run /d:5.50 /t:25:12 /date:07-03-2024</code>

    ![Add first run](img_2101/pulsepilot_commands/run/add_run1.png)

4. Now, let's put the **second** run's details into the flags required:

    - A **20km** run is specified using the `distance` flag via `/d:20.00`.
    - **2 hours, 13 minutes and 37 seconds** is specified using the `time` flag via `/t:02:13:37`
    - **No date** is given, so we can leave the `date` blank.

5. The full command for the second run is:

    <code style="color: green">workout /e:run /d:20.00 /t:02:13:37</code>

#### Add Gym

To add a gym, there are 2 parts to the command:

1. Adding a gym itself using `workout /e:gym`.
2. Adding details for each individual gym station.

To add a gym, the following details and flags must be specified in your input:

| Detail               | Description                                                  | Flag Used | Limitations                                                                                                                                                           |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `number of stations` | The number of gym stations you have done in one gym session. | `/n:`     | Must be a **positive number of at least 1**.                                                                                                                          |
| `date`               | The date of the run. <br>This is an **OPTIONAL** parameter.  | `/date:`  | Must be in `DD-MM-YYYY` format. <br> Date specified **cannot be after today's date**. (i.e. If today is `10-04-2024`, specifying `11-04-2024` will trigger an error!) |

> ‚ùó The `date` parameter is **OPTIONAL**. Not specifying one results in it being recorded as `NA` within PulsePilot, and it is okay! This is similar to the command used for adding a run.

After PulsePilot receives the command to enter a gym, it will prompt you further for additional details for **each station**. If you specified the `number of stations` as `3`, then PulsePilot requires 3 extra lines of input from you!

The following details are required for each station:

| Detail                  | Description                                                                                                                                                 | Flag Used             | Limitations                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| `number of sets`        | The number of sets done at each station.                                                                                                                    | `/s:`                 | Must be a **positive number of at least 1**                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `number of repetitions` | The number of repetitions done at each station.                                                                                                             | `/r:`                 | Must be a **positive number of at least 1**                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `weights`               | The weight done for each set in **kilograms**, separated by commas. <br> (i.e. If you have used 70kg and 75kg at one station, use `70,75` to specify that.) | `/w:`                 | Must **only contain numbers and commas**, as all other characters will trigger errors.  <br> Each number specified must be a multiple of `0.125`. <br>     Numbers specified **must be at least 0, and less than 2850**. |

The following example will cover how to add a gym session step-by-step.

1. Suppose you want to add a **gym session**, where you did **3 stations on 10 March 2024**. Here is the breakdown of your workout:

    - Station 1: **4 sets** of **4 repetitions** of **Bench Press** using **100kg, 105kg, 110kg and 112.5kg** respectively.
    - Station 2: **5 sets** of **5 repetitions** of **Deadlift** using **150kg, 150kg, 160kg, 160kg and 170kg** respectively.
    - Station 3: **3 sets** of **10 repetitions** of Squats using **100.5kg, 115kg and 110kg** respectively.

2. Let's put the gym details into the flags required:

    - **3 gym stations** is specified using the `number of stations` flag via `/n:3`.
    - **10 March 2024** is specified using the `date` flag via `/date:10-03-2024`.

3. Putting it together, the full command to use is:

    <code style="color: green">workout /e:gym /n:3 /date:10-03-2024</code>

    ![Workout Gym Command](img_2101/pulsepilot_commands/gym/initial_workout.png)

4. Now, we can put the 3 gym stations into the flags required and enter them as input:

    - Station 1: <code style="color: green">Bench Press /s:4 /r:4 /w:100,105,110,112.5</code>
    - Station 2: <code style="color: green">Deadlift /s:5 /r:5 /w:150,150,160,160,170</code>
    - Station 3: <code style="color: green">Squat /s:3 /r:10 /w:100.5,115,110</code>

### Health

Besides tracking your workout sessions, PulsePilot can also record Period, Bmi and medical appointment entries, as well as make period predictions. This is implemented via the `health` command.

There are 4 types of health features, denoted using the `/h:` flag.

- To add a Period input, use `health /h:period`.

- To add a Bmi input, use `health /h:bmi`.

- To add an Appointment input, use `health /h:appointment`.

- To make period prediction, use `health /h:prediction`.

#### Add Period

To add a period, the following details and flags are required in your input:

| Detail       | Description                                                            | Flag Used | Limitations                                                                                                                                                           |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `start date` | The first day of period flow which is also the first day of the cycle. | `/start:` | Must be in `DD-MM-YYYY` format. <br> Date specified **cannot be after today's date**. (i.e. If today is `10-04-2024`, specifying `11-04-2024` will trigger an error!) |
| `end date`   | The last day of period flow. <br>This is an **OPTIONAL** parameter.    | `/end:`   | Must be in `DD-MM-YYYY` format. <br> Date specified **cannot be after today's date**. (i.e. If today is `10-04-2024`, specifying `11-04-2024` will trigger an error!) |

> üí° You may first record the start date and add in the end date later on! Not specifying the end date results in it being recorded as `NA` within PulsePilot. 

> ‚ùó Every period input needs to contain both start and end dates eventually. An error message will be printed if you attempt to record a new period input without specifying the end date of the outstanding period entry. Fret not! Simply complete the outstanding period before proceeding with the new period input.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The start date of a new period entry must be after the end date of the previous period entry. 
> 
> You can use the `history` command explained [here](#view-history) in the later part of the guide to view the periods recorded thus far. Or, you can use the `latest` command explained [here](#view-latest), also in the later part of the guide, to view the most recent period entry. From there, you can find out what is the end date of the previous period entry.

The following examples will cover how to add a period step-by-step, with the latter example showcasing how to add start and end dates at different times. 

1. Suppose you want to add **both start and end dates** at once. 
   - The `start date` is `01-01-2024` and `end date` is `08-01-2024`.

2. Let's put the necessary Period's details together with their respective flags into a complete command.
    - <code style="color: green;">health /h:period /start:01-01-2024 /end:08-01-2024</code>

3. Entering it into PulsePilot results in this output:

    ![Add both dates](img_2101/pulsepilot_commands/health/full_period.png)

4. Congratulations! You have successfully added a period input to PulsePilot. 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è PulsePilot automatically calculates your period length. You will see an error message printed to the screen if your period length is beyond the healthy range of **2-7 days**. 
> 
> Don't worry too much, your period will still be recorded in PulsePilot as per normal! And menstrual cycles can vary greatly from person to person! Deviations from the healthy range set by PulsePilot are not uncommon and may be perfectly normal for you. However, if you are experiencing any unusual symptoms, it may be good to seek professional help.


1. Suppose you want to add the **start date only**.
   - The `start date` is `01-01-2024`.

2. Let's put the necessary Period's detail together with its respective flag into a command.
    - <code style="color: green;">health /h:period /start:01-01-2024</code>

3. Entering it into PulsePilot results in this output:

    ![Add start date](img_2101/pulsepilot_commands/health/start_date_only.png)

4. To add in the `end date`, simply enter the command <code style="color: green;">health /h:period /start:01-01-2024 /end:08-01-2024</code>. You will see the same output as the previous example where both dates are added at once.

    ![After adding end date](img_2101/pulsepilot_commands/health/full_period.png)

5. Congratulations! The end date of the period input has been successfully added.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Remember: You **must** add an end date for the current period entry before you can add your next period entry! Once again, you can use `history` command [here](#view-history) or `latest` command [here](#view-latest) to see whether you have added the end date.

#### Add BMI

To add a BMI entry, the following details and flags are required in your input:

| Detail   | Description                               | Flag Used  | Limitations                                                                                                                                                           |
|----------|-------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `height` | Your height in **meters**.                | `/height:` | Must be a `2 decimal point positive number` such as `1.75`. <br> Acceptable height range is from **0.01m to 2.75m**.                                                  |
| `weight` | Your weight in **kilograms**.             | `/weight:` | Must be a `2 decimal point positive number` such as `60.00`. <br> Acceptable weight range is from **0.01kg to 640.00kg**.                                             |
| `date`   | The date of taking your height and weight | `/date:`   | Must be in `DD-MM-YYYY` format. <br> Date specified **cannot be after today's date**. (i.e. If today is `10-04-2024`, specifying `11-04-2024` will trigger an error!) |

> ‚ùó The `date` parameter must be **unique** for each BMI input in PulsePilot. An error message is printed if you attempt to add a new BMI input with a date that matches an existing entry.

The following example will cover how to add a bmi step-by-step.

1. Suppose you have just taken your height and weight and want to add a new BMI.
   - Your `height` is 1.75m, `weight` is 60.00kg and the `date` of measurement is `01-01-2024`.

2. Let's put the necessary details together with their respective flags into the command required.
   - <code style="color: green;">health /h:bmi /height:1.75 /weight:60.00 /date:01-01-2024</code>

3. Entering it into PulsePilot results in this output:

    ![Bmi Output](img_2101/pulsepilot_commands/health/bmi.png)

4. Congratulations! You have successfully added a BMI entry to PulsePilot.

> üí° The table below illustrates how PulsePilot categorizes BMI values. This may help you to better understand where your BMI falls within these categories, providing greater insights into your overall health status!

| BMI Range                                               | Limitations    |
|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| `BMI` is less than 18.5.                                | Underweight    |
| `BMI` is more than or equal to 18.5 and less than 25.0. | Normal         |
| `BMI` is more than or equal to 25.0 and less than 30.0. | Overweight     |
| `BMI` is more than or equal to 30.0 and less than 40.0. | Obese          |
| `BMI` is more than 40.0.                                | Severely Obese |

#### Add Appointment

To add an appointment, the following details and flags are required in your input:

| Detail        | Description                                                | Flag Used       | Limitations                                                                                                                                                            |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `date`        | The date of the appointment.                               | `/date:`        | Must be in `DD-MM-YYYY` format. <br> Date specified **cannot be before today's date**. (i.e. If today is `10-04-2024`, specifying `09-04-2024` will trigger an error!) |
| `time`        | The time of the appointment in 24-hour format.             | `/time:`        | Must be in `HH:MM` format. <br> Time ranges from **00:00 to 23:59**.                                                                                                   |
| `description` | The description represents the details of the appointment. | `/description:` | The description can only contain **alphanumeric characters, spaces, inverted commas and quotes**.                                                                      |

The following example will cover how to add an Appointment step-by-step.

1. Suppose you want to add an upcoming appointment with the following details. 
   - The `date` is `01-01-2024`, the `time` is `14:15` and the `description` is `review checkup with surgeon`. 

2. Let's put the necessary Appointment's details together with their respective flags into a complete command.
    - <code style="color: green;">health /h:appointment /date:01-01-2024 /time:14:15 /description:review checkup with surgeon</code>

3. Entering it into PulsePilot results in this output:

> ‚ùóPlease ensure that PulsePilot contains a minimum of **4** period inputs before using this feature.

The following example will illustrate how to make a prediction.

1. Simply enter the command <code style="color: green;">health /h:prediction</code>. 

2. Entering it into PulsePilot prints the following:

    ![Period Prediction Output](img_2101/pulsepilot_commands/health/prediction.png)


> üí° Do remember to regularly update PulsePilot with your period inputs for more accurate and recent prediction.

##### Error Messages

> ‚ùó This is just one example of invalid input. The full list of errors is not covered here.

**Not enough period entries added**:

### View History

Once items have been added, the `history` command can be used to view all the items added.

To do so, the following details flags are required in your input:

| Detail         | Description                                            | Flag Used | Limitations                                                                               |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `history item` | The name of the item you want to view the history for. | `/item:`  | Can **only** be set to either `workouts`, `gym`, `run`, `period`, `bmi` or `appointment`. |

The `history item` detail will print out the different histories of objects you have added. If specified to `workouts`, it prints **all runs and gyms** recorded.

The following example shows how to view the history step-by-step:

1. Suppose you have added **a run, gym and BMI entry**, and want to view all of them.

2. You can choose to view the `run` history using the command:

    <code style="color: green">history /item:run</code>

    ![View Run History](img_2101/pulsepilot_commands/history/view_run.png)

3. BMI history can be viewed using:

    <code style="color: green">history /item:bmi</code>

    ![View BMI History](img_2101/pulsepilot_commands/history/view_bmi.png)

4. All the workouts can be viewed using:

    <code style="color: green">history /item:workouts</code>

    ![View Workouts](img_2101/pulsepilot_commands/history/view_workouts.png)

#### Error Messages

### View Latest

For viewing either the **last entry** for items using `latest`.

To do so, the following details and flags must be specified in your input:

| Detail        | Description                                            | Flag Used | Limitations                                                                   |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `latest item` | The name of the item you want to view the history for. | `/item:`  | Can **only** be set to either `gym`, `run`, `period`, `bmi` or `appointment`. |

The following example will cover how to use the `latest` command step-by-step:

1. Suppose you have 2 appointments added, one on **20-05-2024** and the other on **20-06-2024**. This is viewable using the `history` command:

    ![View Appointment](img_2101/pulsepilot_commands/history/appt.png)
  
2. The `latest` command would print the **last appointment** added:

    <code style="color: green">latest /item:appointment</code>

### Delete Item

For removing things PulsePilot has recorded using `delete`.

To do so, the following details and flags must be specified in your input:

| Detail         | Description                                            | Flag Used | Limitations                                                                   |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `delete item`  | The name of the item you want to view the history for. | `/item:`  | Can **only** be set to either `gym`, `run`, `period`, `bmi` or `appointment`. |
| `delete index` | The index of the item you want to delete.              | `/item:`  | Must be a **number of at least 1**.                                           |

The following example shows how the `delete` command can be used:

1. Suppose you have **2 runs** added. This can be viewed using the `history` command:

    ![2 runs](img_2101/pulsepilot_commands/delete/2runsadded.png)

2. The runs have an `Index` column on the left, which is the number required for the `delete index` detail. The first run can be deleted using `delete`, then `history` is used to check whether it has been deleted:

    <code style="color: green">delete /item:run /index:1</code>
    
    ![Deleted Run](img_2101/pulsepilot_commands/delete/delete_run.png)

## Common Problems

### Odd Characters on Screen

In some instances, the output from an error will result in odd characters being printed on screen:

![Colour not rendering](../img/output/colour_not_rendered.png)

This issue affects Windows machines. The odd characters are actually special characters used to **display colour** in the terminal. **Windows 10 users** do not have this enabled by default. For Windows 11, these are automatically enabled and hence this problem does not occur.

This is what the output is supposed to look like when the same command is used on a Windows 11 computer:

![Colour Rendered](../img/output/correct_colour_render.png)

This merely a visual difference, and it does not mean PulsePilot is not working. **You can safely ignore this and continue using PulsePilot.**

> üí° These 'special characters' are actually called [ANSI escape sequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code). If you want to view PulsePilot in colour, please enable them for your Windows computer using [this guide](#https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeJOyEw3RtM). **macOS and Linux users are unaffected!**

## Frequently Asked Questions

**1.** How do I transfer my data to another computer?

To transfer your data to another computer, make sure that `pulsepilot.jar` is placed in the **same folder** as `pulsepilot_data.txt` **and** `pulsepilot_hash.txt`. If done correctly, PulsePilot will recognize and synchronize your data.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Create a _backup copy_ of both `pulsepilot_data.txt` and `pulsepilot_hash.txt` prior to file transfer to avoid data corruption.
>
> The _backup copies_ should be stored in a **separate** folder location from where the original `pulsepilot.jar` is saved.


**2.** What happens if my data is corrupted or tampered with?

> ‚ùó **_WARNING_: DO NOT** tamper with either `pulsepilot_data.txt` or `pulsepilot_hash.txt` to prevent **permanent** and **unrecoverable** loss of data.



You may experience 2 scenarios:

- A data file content corruption:

![Data Corruption](../img/output/data_corruption.png)

Corruption of the `pulsepilot_data.txt` or `pulsepilot_hash.txt` files will result in **permanent and complete data loss**.

- A missing file error:

![Missing Files](../img/output/missing_files.png)

A missing file error occurs when either `pulsepilot_data.txt` or `pulsepilot_hash.txt` is missing when PulsePilot is run. For safety and security reasons, PulsePilot will automatically delete any remaining data files before exiting the application.

**Both cases will inevitably result in permanent and complete data loss.**

> ‚ùó **DATA RECOVERY:** In both cases, you may want to recover data by utilising **both** your _backup_ copies of  `pulsepilot_data.txt` and `pulsepilot_hash.txt` to restore your data.

Otherwise, if you have lost your data, you can reinitialize a new save file by running the command `java -jar pulsepilot.jar` again.

**3.** Is my tracking data private and confidential?

Yes, your data is secure and stored locally on your machine. PulsePilot does not have any features that would allow it to send your data elsewhere.

**4.** What happens if I specify extra flags on accident?
   
Note that if you add duplicate or extra flags, the bot **will read the first instance only**.

**All other parameters will be ignored.**

For example, if you entered:

```
workout /e:run /d:5.25 /t:59:50 /d:10.55
```

In the above output, the bot will read `5.25` as the distance. The second `/d:10.55` is **ignored**.

**5.** What if I keep receiving an error message even though my input seems to follow the instructions given in the user guide?

>‚ùó Please ensure that you follow the command syntax given **exactly** in the user guide.
 
Here are some mistakes that could be easily overlooked:

Example of the correct command to input:

![correct_command.png](../img/correct_command.png)

- Error of **adding extra space(s)** in fixed parameters:
    - In this case, the altered fixed parameter is `/date:`, which was written as `/ date:` instead.

![extra_space_error_command.png](../img/extra_space_error_command.png)

- Error of **adding extra newline(s)** after command:

![extra_newline_error_command.png](../img/extra_newline_error_command.png)

Avoid using extra characters in the commands, such as blank space, newline, etc.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Try not to copy the code from somewhere else and paste directly into the command, as there could be unnoticeable extra characters that you are not aware of.
